**ABSTRACT**
Long COVID or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) is a clinical syndrome featuring diverse symptoms that can persist for months following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aetiologies may include persistent inflammation, unresolved tissue damage or delayed clearance of viral protein or RNA, but the biological differences they represent are not fully understood. Here we evaluate the serum proteome in samples, longitudinally collected from 55 PASC individuals with symptoms lasting ≥60 days after onset of acute infection, in comparison to samples from symptomatically recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected individuals. Our analysis indicates heterogeneity in PASC and identified subsets with distinct signatures of persistent inflammation. Type II interferon signaling and canonical NF-κB signaling (particularly associated with TNF), appear to be the most differentially enriched signaling pathways, distinguishing a group of patients characterized also by a persistent neutrophil activation signature. These findings help to clarify biological diversity within PASC, identify participants with molecular evidence of persistent inflammation, and highlight dominant pathways that may have diagnostic or therapeutic relevance, including a protein panel that we propose as diagnostic utility for differentiating inflammatory and non-inflammatory PASC.
