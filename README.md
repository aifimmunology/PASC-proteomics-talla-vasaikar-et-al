**One Sentence Summary:** Serum proteome profiling identifies subsets of long COVID patients
with evidence of persistent inflammation including key immune signaling pathways that may be
amenable to therapeutic intervention.

**ABSTRACT**
Long COVID or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) is a clinical syndrome featuring
diverse symptoms that can persist for months after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The etiologies
are unknown but may include persistent inflammation, unresolved tissue damage, or delayed
clearance of viral protein or RNA. Attempts to classify subsets of PASC by symptoms alone
have been unsuccessful. To molecularly define PASC, we evaluated the serum proteome in
longitudinal samples from 55 PASC individuals with symptoms lasting ≥60 days after onset of
acute infection and compared this to symptomatically recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected and
uninfected individuals. We identified subsets of PASC with distinct signatures of persistent
inflammation. Type II interferon signaling and canonical NF-κB signaling (particularly
associated with TNF), were the most differentially enriched pathways. These findings help to
resolve the heterogeneity of PASC, identify patients with molecular evidence of persistent
inflammation, and highlight dominant pathways that may have diagnostic or therapeutic
relevance.
